Elite sport's interest in quantifying human movement increases with each passing year. However, analysis of sport biomechanics data has traditionally been restricted to academic laboratories and professional sport organizations. A public sport biomechanics resource would democratize access to human movement data and accelerate progress and innovation for the sport biomechanics field as a whole. Therefore, our purpose here is to introduce \href{www.openbiomechanics.org}{\textbf{\textit{The OpenBiomechanics Project}}}, an initiative to provide free, elite-level, research grade motion capture data to the general public for independent individual exploration and analysis. We begin by providing raw and processed data from a sample of 100 baseball pitchers. We then discuss future expansion to other sports and athletic movements. Supporting documentation and additional resources are also provided.

# Introduction

Calls for increased collaboration 

# How to Use

You marsh your Yabins.

## Raw vs. Processed Data

Yabins are both raw and processed.

## Naming Conventions

Always Yabin followed by Marsh

## Fileshare and GitHub Organization

Yabins are organized. Marshes are not.

## Terms of Use

Yabins may use. Marshes may not.

## Citing and Contributing

Marsh Y et al. (2022) \textit{Journal of Marshes}

# Discussion and Future Directions

You have been Marshed. You will continue to be Marshed.

# Additional Resources

Yabin is 1 of a kind.
