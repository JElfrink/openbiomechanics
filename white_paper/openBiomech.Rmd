\begin{abstract}
Interest in quantifying human movement, particularly in elite sport, increases with each passing year. However, analysis of sport biomechanics data has traditionally been restricted to academic laboratories and professional sport organizations. Public sport biomechanics resources would democratize access to human movement data and accelerate progress and innovation for the sport biomechanics field as a whole. In this paper, we introduce \href{www.openbiomechanics.org}{\textbf{\textit{The OpenBiomechanics Project}}}, an initiative started by \href{https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/research/}{\textbf{\textit{Driveline Baseball Research \& Development}}} to provide free, elite-level, research grade motion capture data to the general public for independent individual exploration and analysis. We begin by providing raw and processed data from a sample of 100 baseball pitchers. We then discuss future directions within baseball, expansion to other sports and athletic movements, and outline supporting documentation and additional resources.

# Introduction

Open access resources exist in other biomechanics sub disciplines \cite{camargo2021comprehensive, erdemir2016open}. 

# Data collection

Data collection took place at Driveline Baseball in Kent, Washington, USA as part of each athlete's motion capture assessment. After a standardized warm up consisting of static and dynamic stretching, resistance band exercises, and preparatory throwing drills, we applied between 45 and 48 reflective markers directly to the athlete's skin over relevant bony landmarks (Table \ref{tbl:marker_set}). We then allowed athletes to complete a final warm up consisting of preparatory throws from the pitching mound. Once the athlete indicated they felt ready to throw with game-like effort, we recorded up to five fastball pitches from a pitching mound at a regulation distance (18.4 m). 

Although athletes were cued to throw at the provided strike zone, we did not require athletes to throw a strike for a trial to be considered valid. We considered a trial valid if all reflective markers remained affixed to the athlete throughout the pitching motion. A radar gun positioned behind home plate measured pitch velocity to the nearest tenth of a mile per hour which we recorded and paired with each motion capture trial.

During each athlete's assessment, fourteen cameras (Prime 17W; Optitrack/NaturalPoint Inc., Corvallis, OR, USA) recorded marker positions at 360 Hz while three force plates embedded in a custom concrete mound (1 x FP4080-15-TM-2000, 2 x FP9090-15-TM-2000; Bertec Corp., Columbus, OH, USA) collected ground reaction force data at 1,080 Hz. Marker and ground reaction force data were synchronized and recorded using Motive Optitrack software.
