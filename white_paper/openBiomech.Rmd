Elite sport's interest in quantifying human movement increases with each passing year. However, analysis of sport biomechanics data has traditionally been restricted to academic laboratories and professional sport organizations. A public sport biomechanics resource would democratize access to human movement data and accelerate progress and innovation for the sport biomechanics field as a whole. Therefore, our purpose here is to introduce \href{www.openbiomechanics.org}{\textbf{\textit{The OpenBiomechanics Project}}}, an initiative to provide free, elite-level, research grade motion capture data to the general public for independent individual exploration and analysis. We begin by providing raw and processed data from a sample of 100 baseball pitchers. We then discuss future expansion to other sports and athletic movements. Supporting documentation and additional resources are also provided.
