# **Driveline Baseball OBDB High Performance Assessment Documentation**

Our assessment process utilizes force plate tests paired with motion capture data to provide a comprehensive analysis of an athlete’s performance. This documentation outlines the key tests we use, their significance, and how we integrate the collected data

## **Testing Battery (Protocols included in links)-**

### [**Isometric Mid-Thigh Pull (IMTP)**](https://vimeo.com/972866323/3cc3060c4a)

The IMTP assesses lower body maximal strength by measuring the force an athlete can exert in a static position. This test is critical for understanding an athlete's raw strength and capacity to produce force, which is foundational for many athletic movements.

**Significance:**

* **Net Peak Force (Net PF):** Indicates absolute strength, or how much total force an athlete is capable of producing  
* **Relative Strength:** Shows strength in relation to bodyweight, useful for weight-class sports and performance optimization.

### [**Countermovement Jump (CMJ)**](https://vimeo.com/972660522/7656aa79fa)

The CMJ evaluates lower body explosive strength by measuring the athlete’s ability to generate power using a countermovement. It provides insights into an athlete’s vertical jump performance and overall power production.

**Significance:**

* **Jump Height:** Directly correlates with lower body power, a key indicator of athletic performance.  
* **Asymmetries:** Identifies imbalances between limbs, which can inform targeted training interventions.  
* **Rate of Force Development:** Assesses explosive power capabilities, important for sports requiring rapid movements.

### [**Squat Jump (SJ)**](https://vimeo.com/972826412/9daaa9c9cf)

The SJ measures lower body explosive strength from a static position, eliminating the stretch-shortening cycle. This test focuses on pure concentric power generation without the aid of pre-stretch.

**Significance:**

* **Peak Power:** Indicates the ability to generate maximal force quickly, essential for explosive activities.  
* **Jump Height:** Directly correlates with lower body power, a key indicator of athletic performance.  
* **Asymmetries:** Highlights discrepancies between limbs, useful for injury prevention and rehabilitation.  
* **Eccentric Utilization Ratio (EUR):** Compares CMJ to SJ height to evaluate an athlete’s ability to utilize the stretch-shortening cycle.

### [**Repeated Hop Test**](https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/972840700/05fb7485ca)

The repeated hop test assesses lower body reactive ability by measuring the athlete’s capacity to quickly transition from eccentric to concentric movements. 

**Significance:**

* **Reactive Strength Index (RSI):** Combines flight time and ground contact time to assess explosive efficiency.  
* **Ground Contact Time:** Measures how quickly an athlete can rebound, important for reactive sports.  
* **Flight Time:** Reflects the height of each hop, indicating power and endurance.

**Basic Metrics Overview-** 

**Asymmetry Metrics**

**Asymmetry**: A relative measurement of difference between two-sided values expressed as a percentage. Calculated as (Left Metric value – Right Metric value) / maximum of (Left Metric value or Right Metric value) x 100\.

#### **Force Metrics**

1. **Left Force**: The vertical Force component measured from the left force plate (N).  
1. **Right Force**: The vertical Force component measured from the right force plate (N).  
1. **Vertical Force**: The vertical force component measured from a single force plate or combined from both (N).  
1. **Concentric Mean Force**: Average Vertical Force during the Concentric Phase (N).  
1. **Concentric Mean Force/BM**: Concentric Mean Force divided by Body Mass (N/kg).

#### **Rate of Development Metrics**

1. **Rate of Force Development (RFD)**: Change in force over a given time period or phase (N/s).  
1. **Rate of Power Development (RPD)**: Change in power over a given time period or phase (W/s).  
1. **Concentric RFD**: RFD from the start of the Concentric Phase to the point when Peak Force occurs (N/s).  
1. **Concentric RPD**: RPD from the start of the Concentric Phase to the point when Peak Power occurs (W/s).

#### **Impulse Metrics**

1. **Concentric Impulse**: Net Impulse during the Concentric Phase (Ns).  
1. **Concentric Impulse (Abs) / BM**: Absolute Impulse during the Concentric Phase divided by Body Mass (Ns/kg).  
1. **Concentric Impulse-100ms**: Net Impulse during the first 100ms of the Concentric Phase (Ns).  
1. **Concentric Impulse-50ms**: Net Impulse during the first 50ms of the Concentric Phase (Ns).

#### **Power Metrics**

1. **Concentric Mean Power**: Average Power during the Concentric Phase (W).  
1. **Concentric Mean Power / BM**: Concentric Mean Power divided by Body Mass (W/kg).  
1. **Peak Power**: Maximum Power during the Concentric Phase (W).  
1. **Peak Power / BM**: Peak Power divided by Body Mass (W/kg).

#### **Velocity Metrics**

1. **Concentric Mean Velocity**: Average Velocity during the Concentric Phase (m/s).  
1. **Concentric Peak Velocity**: Maximum Velocity during the Concentric Phase (m/s).
